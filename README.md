# I-am
A little bit about me
I have experience testing a web platform and a mobile application, drafting software requirements and developing test documentation, testing new functionality and monitoring bug fixes, worked as the only tester in a small development team. I am currently taking a course on testing automation in java 
Diploma from Yandex Workshop in the field of Software testing Engineer, as part of a team of three people, she was a prize-winner (1st place) in the Bagaton-July 2023 from Yandex (competitions for testers similar to the Hackathon), actively participated in testing pet projects starting from the idea stage, since I have an education in UX/UI design of the web and mobile applications (but I decided not to develop further in design, since this is not my thing). I am used to solving complex tasks and quickly understand what is required of me. 
I want to become a part of your professional team.
